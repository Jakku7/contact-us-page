IN THIS EXERCISE YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT DESIGN GIVEN TO YOU 

1. There is almost blank react-app boilerplate code provided with a design file named template.png. 
2. Please open above-mentioned template file. This is your design.  
3. Please create contact form component first with proper validation (it is at the bottom of the template). There has to be a button on the bottom of the form, which triggers pop-up with the data provided in the contact form. Button should be disabled if input fields are not filled out or they do not validate.   
4. Please use proper regular expressions to validate specific fields (email, etc).
5. Style your app in accordance with the design. This time styling is very important. You can use whatever front-end library you want, but it is not necessary if you feel that you can style everything properly without it. 
6. Use placholder pictures/icons/video or anything you think fit for other sections. 
7. Please use Parallax effect for each section. 
8. Please pay attention to details. 
9. Do not worry about font that much, pick anything that you think is fine.
